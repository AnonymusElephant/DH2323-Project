## Concept

## Starting point
Wanting to create something that was both fun to develop and interact with while also being educational, we choose to start of researching different known principles of pathfinding, noise map generation, and how to implement dynamic environments in a game. This to give us an idea for what we wanted to build and which known algorithms and tools we could use to implement our idea.
